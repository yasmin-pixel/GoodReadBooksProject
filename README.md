# Goodreads Book Data Analysis ðŸ“š

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring a dataset of books, sourced from Goodreads. The goal of this project is to uncover interesting patterns, trends, and insights within the book data. This could involve analyzing authors and publication.

This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating skills in data analysis and visualization using Python. The complete analysis code, performed within a Google colabs Notebook environment, is included in this repository.

## Source

Data is sourced from the `cleanedbooks.csv` file provided by the user.


## Key Variables

* Title
* Author
* Genre
* Publication Year
* Average Rating
* Number of Ratings
* Number of Reviews
* ISBN
* Publisher

## Methodology & Tools

The analysis was conducted using Python within a Googel Colab Notebook environment. Key steps included:

1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Importing the `cleanedbooks.csv` dataset using Pandas, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examining the distribution of key variables, identifying potential outliers, and looking for initial patterns and relationships using Pandas.
3.  **Visualization:** Creating insightful plots using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and/or Plotly to understand the data and communicate findings.

**Main Libraries:**

* **Python:** pandas
* **Python (Visualization):** matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

## Key Findings & Insights (To be populated after analysis)

1. Top 10 Most Occurring Books:

Insight: This bar chart highlights the books that appear most frequently in the dataset. This might be due to different editions or versions of the same book.

2. Top 10 Authors with Most Books:

Insight: This bar chart shows the authors who have published the most books in the dataset.

3. Number of Books Published Over Time:

Insight: This line graph shows a general increase in the number of books published over time, with potential fluctuations or spikes in certain years.

4. Distribution of Text Reviews Count:

Insight: This histogram reveals that the majority of books have a relatively low number of text reviews, with a long tail of books having a higher number of reviews. This indicates that user engagement through text reviews is concentrated on a smaller subset of books.

5. Top 10 Books with Most Text Reviews:

Insight: This bar chart identifies the books that have generated the most discussion and user engagement through text reviews.

## Limitations & Future Work

* **Data Scope:** The analysis is limited to the data available in the `cleanedbooks.csv` file.
* **Potential Biases:** The dataset might reflect biases present in the data source which is Goodreads.
* **Further Exploration:** Future work could involve:
    * Incorporating additional book-related datasets.
    * Performing sentiment analysis on book reviews (if available).
    * Building predictive models (e.g., predicting book ratings).
    * Exploring network analysis of authors or genres.
